      Sky Tycoon is a manegment tycoon game similar to Adventure Capitalist. Where the player places building in order to generate gold. With diffrent buildings generating different amounts. <br>
      On this project, I was part of a group of 2 programmers. It was my first expirence working on a team in a professional enviroment.<br>
      Unfortuantly, as this project is being developed for a client. And is not currently released. I can't provide the source, or a link to the product. But I can provide a video of the gameplay.
