      This game was created by 4 people, as a group entry to the Summer 2017 Ludum Dare game competition. <br>
      Ludum Dare is a competition in which you compete against thousands of other developers, both in groups and solo, to make a game in either 48 or 72 hours, depending on the competition. <br>
      During this time you need to come up with an idea based on the theme, and then develop it. <br>
      The theme was 'Running out of space'. After many failed ideas, Some going further than others. We settled on the idea of using the floor as ammo to shoot aliens, in order to survice. To add an element of challenge we changed the type of ammo that you get for mining each tile. <br>
