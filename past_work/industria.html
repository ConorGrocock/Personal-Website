      It was created by 3 people over the course of a weekend, with the theme of 'Running out of power'.
      Industria is the first game that I made for Ludum Dare, It was also one of the first software projects I worked on in a group.
      As well as that, it was the first thing I made or helped to make that I got user feedback on. I'd had feedback on things like class projects. But never from an end user. This has really helped me better understand how the stuff I write will be used.
